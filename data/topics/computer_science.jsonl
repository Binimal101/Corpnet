{"text": "Alan Turing proposed the concept of a universal computing machine in 1936, now known as the Turing machine. This theoretical model forms the foundation of computer science and defines what is computationally possible."}
{"text": "The Von Neumann architecture, introduced in 1945, describes a computer design where program instructions and data share the same memory. Most modern computers still follow this fundamental architecture with modifications."}
{"text": "Big O notation is used to describe the computational complexity of algorithms. It expresses how the runtime or space requirements grow relative to input size, with common complexities including O(1), O(log n), O(n), and O(n²)."}
{"text": "The TCP/IP protocol suite, developed in the 1970s by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, forms the foundation of internet communication. TCP ensures reliable data transmission while IP handles addressing and routing of packets."}
{"text": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) organizes code around objects that combine data and behavior. The four pillars of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling modular and reusable code design."}
{"text": "Relational databases, introduced by Edgar Codd in 1970, organize data into tables with rows and columns. SQL (Structured Query Language) became the standard language for querying and manipulating relational data."}
{"text": "The halting problem, proven undecidable by Turing in 1936, demonstrates that no algorithm can determine whether an arbitrary program will eventually halt or run forever. This establishes fundamental limits on computation."}
{"text": "Public key cryptography, invented independently by Diffie-Hellman and RSA in the 1970s, enables secure communication without shared secrets. It relies on mathematical problems like integer factorization being computationally difficult."}
{"text": "Machine learning algorithms learn patterns from data rather than following explicit programming. Supervised learning uses labeled examples, unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns, and reinforcement learning optimizes through trial and error."}
{"text": "The CAP theorem states that distributed systems can only guarantee two of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. This fundamental trade-off influences the design of distributed databases and services."}
{"text": "Version control systems like Git track changes to code over time, enabling collaboration among developers. Git uses a distributed model where each developer has a complete copy of the repository history."}
{"text": "Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It achieves O(log n) time complexity, much faster than linear search."}
{"text": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. Every recursive algorithm must have a base case to prevent infinite recursion."}
{"text": "Hash tables provide average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups by using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets. Collisions are handled through chaining or open addressing."}
{"text": "The OSI model divides network communication into seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. Each layer provides services to the layer above it."}
{"text": "Garbage collection automatically manages memory by reclaiming objects that are no longer reachable by the program. Common algorithms include mark-and-sweep, reference counting, and generational collection."}
{"text": "ACID properties ensure database transaction reliability: Atomicity means all-or-nothing execution, Consistency maintains valid states, Isolation prevents interference between transactions, and Durability guarantees persistence."}
{"text": "Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It uses a priority queue to greedily select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance."}
{"text": "The P versus NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved. It remains one of the most important unsolved problems in computer science."}
{"text": "Functional programming emphasizes immutable data and pure functions without side effects. Languages like Haskell and features in JavaScript support higher-order functions, map, filter, and reduce operations."}
{"text": "Cache memory provides fast access to frequently used data by storing copies closer to the CPU. Cache hits are fast retrievals while cache misses require slower access to main memory."}
{"text": "Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are essential for text processing, validation, and search operations in programming and command-line tools."}
{"text": "Deadlock occurs when two or more processes are blocked forever, each waiting for resources held by another. Prevention strategies include resource ordering, timeout mechanisms, and deadlock detection algorithms."}
{"text": "Virtualization technology allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine. Hypervisors manage virtual machines by abstracting hardware resources and providing isolation between guests."}
{"text": "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs."}
{"text": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a growing list of records linked using cryptographic hashes. It enables decentralized consensus without requiring a trusted central authority."}
{"text": "Quicksort is an efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with average O(n log n) time complexity. It works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around it."}
{"text": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. Deep learning uses multiple layers of neurons to learn hierarchical representations of data for tasks like image recognition."}
{"text": "Containerization packages applications with their dependencies into isolated units that run consistently across different computing environments. Docker popularized container technology for modern software deployment."}
{"text": "The Internet of Things (IoT) connects physical devices embedded with sensors and software to exchange data over networks. Applications range from smart homes to industrial automation and healthcare monitoring."}
{"text": "Concurrency involves multiple computations executing during overlapping time periods, while parallelism executes multiple computations simultaneously on multiple processors. Both require careful synchronization to avoid race conditions."}
